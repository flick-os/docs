# Roadmap

Planned next steps and future enhancements:

- Heap expansion (request additional pages when exhausted)
- Page allocation APIs for future paging & virtual memory work
- Timer + scheduling primitives (PIT / HPET / APIC)
- Exception stubs with register dump & fault decoding
- Improved console (ANSI colors, scrolling regions)
- Enhanced memory map classification (more UEFI types, reserved tracking)
- ELF loader (modules or future userspace experiments)
